        "question": "What is the relationship between force and mass? ",
        "choices": [
            {"label": "A", "text": "Force is the product of mass and acceleration."},
            {"label": "B", "text": "Force is the sum of mass and acceleration."},
            {"label": "C", "text": "Force is the difference between mass and acceleration."},
            {"label": "D", "text": "There is no relationship between force and mass."}
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's second law states that F = m * a."
