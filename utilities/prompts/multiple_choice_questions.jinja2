I have read the following text, delimited by triple quotes:

"""
{{ text }} 
"""

Generate three multiple choice questions to evaluate my understanding of the content. 

Responses must contain a JSON array of three objects. Each object must include a "question", four "choices", the "answer", and an "explanation". 

The "explanation" must clearly explain to the user why the correct answer is right.

Here is an example showing the response structure:
"""
{
    "evaluation": [
        {
            "question": "What is the relationship between force and mass? ",
            "choices": [
                {"label": 1, "text": "Force is the product of mass and acceleration."},
                {"label": 2, "text": "Force is the sum of mass and acceleration."},
                {"label": 3, "text": "Force is the difference between mass and acceleration."},
                {"label": 4, "text": "There is no relationship between force and mass."}
            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Newton's second law states that F = m * a."
        },
        {
            ... # another question
        },
        {
            ... # another question
        }
    ]
}
